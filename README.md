# avalon

# Overview 
Avalon fingertips is a substructure fingerprint for similarity search based on 16 features of a molecule graph.
- **Input**: SMILES (what input does the model take?)
- **Output**: 1024-bit vector (what is the unit of the output?)
- **Output explanation**: Bitvector representation of a molecule (what does the output describe or mean?)
- **Threshold**: None (is there a point or range that the predict output should be guarded by?)
- **Training data**: 143,000 molecules (how many compounds or molecules, or what databases were used to train the model?)
- **Experimental validation**: No (was the model tested experimentally?)

# Specifications 
- Model is ready (what is the status of the model? Is it ready or in progress?)
- Model type is regression (does the model predict discrete output (classification) or continuous output (regression)?
- Model is pretrained (is the model based on another model (pretrained)? Or the model was trained from scratch with updated training data (retrained)?
- Model tags: fingerprint, ML, substructure
